            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>I started out my engineering career working on relational databases. This gave me a data-centric perspective, and I have been growing out my skills to solve a number of problems that hinder progress. I have worked with Python and Ruby projects, but I'm learning to pair my knowledge of those languages with Javascript and React.</p>
            <h3>Interests</h3>
            <p>I love being outside, learning, and helping people. I've found that scouts covers all of those, so I volunteer my time with my kids' scout units. I've found that I've learned quite a bit through that role even though I'm not the intended target.</p>
